# Deployment Workflow

## Overview

This project uses a **Git-based CI/CD workflow** with Vercel. Manual deployments via the CLI (`vercel --prod`) are disabled to prevent accidental production overrides.

## Branch Strategy

### `dev` (Development)

- **Purpose:** All active development happens here.
- **Preview:** Pushing to `dev` automatically triggers a **Vercel Preview Deployment**.
- **Action:**
  ```bash
  git checkout dev
  git add .
  git commit -m "feat: description"
  git push origin dev
  ```

### `main` (Production)

- **Purpose:** Stable production code. Live site.
- **Protection:** Direct pushes are blocked. You **must** use a Pull Request.
- **Deploy:** Merging a PR into `main` automatically triggers a **Production Deployment**.

## How to Deploy

1.  **Develop:** Make changes on `dev` (or a feature branch) and push.
2.  **Verify:** Check the Vercel Preview URL generated by the push.
3.  **Release:** Open a Pull Request from `dev` -> `main` on GitHub.
4.  **Merge:** Once approved, merge the PR. Vercel will deploy to production automatically.

> **Note:** If you try to run `npm run deploy`, it will fail intentionally to remind you of this workflow.
